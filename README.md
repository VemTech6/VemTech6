<h2>Why I Do This</h2>
Cybersecurity isn't just a career path for me, it's a mission. I'm driven by the challenge of understanding how systems break so I can learn how to secure them. Every tool I use, every script I write, and every project I build is part of a bigger goal: to become someone who can protect people, data, and infrastructure in a world that grows more connected and more vulnerable, every day.

From configuring firewalls to simulating attacks with a Rubber Ducky, I don't just want to know how things work, I want to know why they fail and how to defend them. This documentation is part of that journey. It's hands-on, it's messy, and it's real. Just like the field I'm preparing to be a part of.
